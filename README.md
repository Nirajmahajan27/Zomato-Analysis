Developed robust DAX measures to calculate:
Active Users: Number of users actively engaging with the platform.
Gained/Lost Users: Dynamics of user growth and churn.
Sales Metrics: Total sales, sales by city, and sales by category.
Ratings: Aggregated customer satisfaction ratings city-wise and overall.
Yearly Trends: Sales and orders segmented by year for trend analysis.

### 3. Interactive Visualizations
Designed visuals with dynamic buttons and slicers for intuitive navigation.
Built city-wise, category-wise, and year-wise filters for granular data exploration.
Included key performance indicators (KPIs) for real-time decision-making.

### 4. Comprehensive Insights
City-Wise Performance: Top-performing cities based on user activity, orders, and sales.
Category-Wise Analysis: Identification of the best-selling product categories.
Rating Metrics: City-wise breakdown of customer satisfaction levels.
